    This skill provides comprehensive task management operations that can be used
    across CLI, API, and web interfaces. It follows CRUD patterns and includes
    advanced features like search, bulk operations, and filtering.

  examples:
    - name: Add a task via CLI
      command: task add "Buy groceries" --priority high

    - name: List all incomplete tasks
